Step 1
In a large pot over medium heat, melt butter. Add carrots and celery and season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring often, until vegetables are tender, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds.

Step 2
Add flour and stir until vegetables are coated, then add chicken, thyme, bay leaf, potatoes, and broth. Season with salt and pepper. Bring mixture to a simmer and cook until the chicken is no longer pink and potatoes are tender, 15 minutes.

Step 3
Remove from heat and transfer chicken to a medium bowl. Using two forks, shred chicken into small pieces and return to pot. 

(Optional)
Garnish with parsley.
